	<h2 id = "heading1">Methodology Used</h2>
		<p id = "p1">
		The methodology that we used in our project was Waterfall. Although Waterfall is not considered the best project management method due to its issues with 
		non-adaptive constraints, it worked best for us. We did not have to worry about customer feedback and we could easily test our project after it was completed.
